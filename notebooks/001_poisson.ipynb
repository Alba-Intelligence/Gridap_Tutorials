    "We want to solve the Possion equation on the 3D domain depicted in the figure below with dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Dirichlet boundary conditions are applyed on $\\Gamma_{\\rm D}$, being the outer sides of the prism (marked in red). Non-homogeneous Neumann conditions are applyed to the internal boundaries $\\Gamma_{\\rm G}$, $\\Gamma_{\\rm Y}$, and $\\Gamma_{\\rm B}$ (marked in green, yelow and blue respectively). And homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are applyed in the remaining portion of the boundary $\\Gamma_{\\rm W}$ (marked in white).\n",
